Today, we are launching this website to enable greater level of engagement with the local Clojure community.

This launch was a part of the [Hacking Session](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Clojure-User-Group/events/252993263/) in today's meetup - in fact, I am writing this post in the ongoing meetup session ðŸ™‚

We plan to keep updating meetup details, along with talks' slides and videos. Stay tuned for updates.
