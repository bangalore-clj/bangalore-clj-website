The Bangalore Clojure Group hosts one of the most active (since 2013) meetups for Clojure in India, each of our meetups are conducted in different locations with different set of speakers every month.Our meetups are scheduled conveniently on every first Saturday of the month.

Our meetups usually have talks by clojurists, but we also do organise hackathons on a regular basis. We are an open community, we encourage all Clojurists & functional freaks without any bais (We also welcome windows users ðŸ™‚)

Happy Clojuring !

Some of our venue sponsors are:

- SAP Concur
- Quintype
- Nilenso
